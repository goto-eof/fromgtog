<h1 align="right" id="title">FromGtoG v. 5.0.0 (WIP)</h1>
A few days ago, I published FromGtoG 3.0 on the [Ubuntu Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/fromgtog).
Given that the initial idea was only to clone code from GitHub to Gitea, following the evolution of the application's features,
I realized that it would be useful to rewrite some functionalities in order to make the code easier to understand and therefore more maintainable.
So, I decided to implement version 5.0 of FromGtoG, in which I make extensive use of several design patterns that improve readability and application modularity, as well as adding new features, such as local to remote cloning.
